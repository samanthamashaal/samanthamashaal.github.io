	<h1> Hello, my name is: </h1>
		<p> Welcome to my very first website! My name is Samantha Mashaal, but all my friends call me Smash. Join me in my attempt to learn how to code (and by that I mean watch how this url gradually becomes somewhat aesthetically pleasing) and pray that I do not end up a SmashedHardDrive. </p>
	<h2> Why you should stick around... </h2>
		<p> I know it may seem like there are millions of other far more interesting sites waiting for to be discovered on the vast world wide web, and there are. So to keep you all engaged, I am making this website a home for my collection of hidden internet gems (i.e.: cool things I've found over the years. Some are useless, some  are not.).</p>
	<h2> Please enjoy! </h2>
